		<H1>Generic DLL GUI Help</H1>
		<P>This is a simple help file that explains the different options of the GUI and a 
			brief explanation of each option.&nbsp; This is not provided as a fully 
			qualified help file.&nbsp; For background reading you should consult the 
			documentation that came&nbsp;with the Generic DLL feature of MATLAB and your 
			DLL that you want to use from MATLAB.</P>
		<H2>Project Name</H2>
		<P>The project name is a string that will be use as the alias for the DLL 
			name.&nbsp; This is needed because sometimes you don't want to use the full DLL 
			name and you would like to have a more descriptive name.&nbsp; For example if 
			you are talking to a VISA32.DLL you probably would call the project 
			"visa"&nbsp; or "tekvisa" both of these names will be used when calling into 
			the library from MATLAB and will be used in the M-Wrapper functions directory 
			name.&nbsp;
		</P>
		<P>Valid strings are any MATLAB valid variable name.&nbsp; This means the first 
			character must be a letter and not a&nbsp;underscore or numbers.</P>
		<H2>DLL Name</H2>
		<P>This is the name of the DLL you wish to load.&nbsp; This can be either the full 
			path and file name or if the file is on the system path then just the file name 
			will work.&nbsp; The dll extension is expected to be part of the string.</P>
		<H2>Header Name</H2>
		<P>This is the header file that defines the DLL functions declarations that are 
			exported from the DLL.&nbsp;
		</P>
		<H2>Additional Include Dir</H2>
		<P>Some header files include other header files that are in a different 
			directory.&nbsp; If this is the case with your header file then you can add the 
			additional include directories here.&nbsp; If multiple directories are needed 
			then separate the directories with a semi-colon ";"</P>
		<H2>Prototype Helper</H2>
		<P>
			Sometimes you need to help the processing of the files.&nbsp; For example some 
			"C" declarations of int8 should be characters in MATLAB and sometimes they 
			should be data stored in size of int8.&nbsp; The Generic DLL loading can not 
			distinguish the difference between what the library is expecting.&nbsp; But if 
			you read the documentation that came with your library then you should be able 
			to determine this.&nbsp; If you want to help generate the 
			correct&nbsp;declarations you can create a file that list the C declaration and 
			then the MATLAB type on a single line.&nbsp; The perl script uses this 
			to&nbsp;determine what to the variable types are in MATLAB. ( An example file 
			is included: "mytypes.txt")</P>
		<H2>Include Standard Windows Headers</H2>
		<P>Some header files require you to include the windows.h file in addition to the 
			header file.&nbsp; By checking this box the GUI will automatically generate a 
			new header file that contains the include of the windows.h file above the 
			header file.</P>
		<H2>Generate M-Wrappers for Functions</H2>
		<P>This option will generate a directory below your current directory.&nbsp; In it 
			will be a series of M-files that MATLAB can use to call into the library.&nbsp; 
			These files are not necessary but are generated so that you can get help and do 
			error checking before calling into the library.&nbsp; It will also generate the 
			M-files needed to load the library.&nbsp; Once these files are generated you 
			can call into the functions directly without loading the library and they will 
			take care of everything for you.</P>
		<P>I added this feature because some of the calls into the library needed dummy 
			parameters passed into the function that really were just returns.&nbsp; When 
			this is the case you can modify the M-file to only pass in what you want and 
			get back only valid responses.
		</P>
		<P>For example in C you may pass in an empty&nbsp;pointer to a char array and get 
			back a valid string.&nbsp; In MATLAB you would&nbsp;expect&nbsp;return a string 
			but not pass in anything.&nbsp; So you can modify the M-File to give normal 
			MATLAB behavior.</P>
		<P>Another example of when this is useful is when the header file uses #defines 
			that you want to use in MATLAB.&nbsp; Now when you call the function you would 
			pass in the same text as you would in C but the M-file would need to be written 
			to convert this to the value in the #define statement. The Constants file 
			information is use also to help with this.</P>
		<H2>Include Constants File</H2>
		<P>Add additional information into the M-File wrappers.&nbsp; This will add the 
			ability to return constant information from the load command generated that 
			returns information you may need for #defines statements in the header.</P>
		<H2>Constants File Reader</H2>
		<P>This is a M-File that reads in the header and returns the information you care 
			about.&nbsp; It should return the information in a structure. ( An example file 
			is included: "loadConstants.m")</P>
		<H2>Constants File</H2>
		<P>The file you wish to pass to the file reader function above.&nbsp; This is 
			useful because sometimes the #defines are in a separate header from the main 
			header used above.</P>
		<H2>Functions Found</H2>
		<P>This lists all the functions found in the DLL that will work in MATLAB.&nbsp; 
			You can use the Apply button to see if everything is working.&nbsp; Also you 
			can see what the C and M declarations look like to help fine tune the options 
			until you get a desired output.&nbsp; For example you will be able to see if 
			there are int8 variables that you want to be strings.&nbsp; If this is the case 
			you can add them to the prototype helper file and press the apply button again.</P>
		<H2>Errors</H2>
		<P>This lists any error that occurred during processing of the files.</P>
		<H1>Tips and Tricks found</H1>
		<H3>Problem:
		</H3>
		<P>If you do not get any functions listed in the Functions Found section.
		</P>
		<H3>Possible solution:
		</H3>
		<P>Some header files define the functions to use __declspec(dllexport) for each 
			function. This is wrong but some compilers don't complain. This normally 
			happens because they gave you the header file they used to create the dll not 
			the header file that is needed for importing the DLL. So remove this #define 
			__declspec(dllexport) form the beginning of each function declaration. This 
			also can be cause by some compiler switches that you needed to add that change 
			the declaration for imported to exporting.&nbsp; Look in the top of your header 
			file for a #define talking about the declspec and add the appropriate #defines 
			before it.

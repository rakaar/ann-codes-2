Matlab changes:
In Matlab, you have to change the connection string to ConnectRZ6 instead of ConnectRX6. 
Also, the supported sampling rates on the RZ6 are more fixed than the RX6, so you should 
run the circuit at the maximum 195312.5Hz.  This is okay because the RZ DSPs have twice 
the capacity of the RX DSPs, so the cycle usage of your circuit running at ~200k on the 
RZ6 is only 46%.  You will have to resample your stimuli to match this new rate.

RCX Circuit changes:
The RZ6 inputs and outputs are handled in the device macros, so replace the DacOut 
components with an RZ6_Audio_Out macro.
I've made these changes to the circuit (attached).
The sample delays on the RZ6 are slightly different.  ADC delay is 66 samples, 
DAC delay is 31 samples.

The maximum samples you can write into the buffer is dependent on the buffer size (see 
RamBuf).  You can find the size in Matlab by calling 'GetTagSize' on the tags connected 
to the Data port of the buffers, like this:
sz1 = RX6_gPL.GetTagSize('play')
sz2 = RX6_gPL.GetTagSize('play_2')

Our ActiveX examples include a 2 channel continuous play example which uses a double-
buffering technique so that you can play stimuli larger than the physical buffer size 
on the hardware.  You can get the examples on our downloads page: http://www.tdt.com/
